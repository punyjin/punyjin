Hello, my name is Wapakrit (xorbit). 
I started studying coding when I was 13 years old. 
I started seriously studying it when I was 15 years old when I was involved in a website project for a game. Written in php, it was my first project and the first language I learned.
That made me study more about html/css/js and about managing PostgreSQL and connecting databases to websites. And during 2019, I was assigned to build a game server system with C#.
Between 2020 - 2023, I enrolled in the field. computer graphics

 Currently, I have learned more about coding. 
 Because I don't think I'm suitable for that job. 
 What I am currently studying is a Front-End subject and I will also study Back-End and other subjects.
 Now I will try to study as much as possible. 
 In order to be able to fulfill my dream of becoming a Game Developer, this is a brief history of myself.

 //I'll ​​come and update again.
