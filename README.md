### My Personal History
I started learning how to code when I was 13, and I started taking it more seriously when I was 15. When I was involved in a website project for a game written in PHP, it was my first project.
And studying PHP helped me dive deeper into HTML/CSS/JS.
and managed PostgreSQL, which connected the database to the website at the time.

In 2019, I was assigned to help build a game server system. 
At that time it was very difficult because I had only just begun to learn how to use C#. 
But luckily, my older siblings were always there to advise me on what to do and to help me.
Really thanks to them.                        
Anyway, I need to learn more about C# to use with Unity as well.

From 2020 to 2023, I studied Computer Graphics. 
When I graduated from that field of study I changed my major to study IT.          
Because I think it's more suitable for me.
And it's my favorite thing to do in my free time.

These days, I'm learning more about coding. in my class I am focused on Back-End development and I plan to explore Front-End and other related subjects. 
I am dedicated to learning as much as possible both inside and outside of the classroom. 

To pursue my dream of becoming a game developer. 
Even though I currently have knowledge in the classroom But I am still actively trying to expand my skills. 
That's a brief overview of my trip.
